The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.
The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.
Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.
